                    <p>In order to provide every SEBS graduate a fair and equal chance at receiving a scholarship
                        award, we adopted a non-discriminatory statement on November 19, 2019 that you can find in the
                        footer of every page on our site. We enforce this statement in our
                        <a href="selection_process.html">application review process</a> by having our security officers
                        anonymize each application. Award recipients must be voted on by the entire selection committee
                        to ensure that the decision isn't made by only a few individuals.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="header"><u>How You Can Help</u></h2>
                    <p>As a small non-profit, we have very limited resources that we are required by law to use for our
                        charitable purpose of providing scholarships (and we have to keep our promise to our amazing
                        donors). Because we aren't able to directly make a contribution, we'd like to encourage everyone
                        to visit the website below for resources and information on how to make an impact.
