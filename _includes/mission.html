                <p>The mission of the SEBS Scholarship Foundation is to assist in paying the costs of post-secondary educational opportunities for graduating students of the School of Engineering and Biomedical Science at Pueblo County High School by awarding annual SEBS Scholarships. Our aim is to help those students who have displayed high academic achievement, work ethic, and a commitment to helping their community and improving themselves through furthering their education.</p>

                <p>Founded by the SEBS class of 2017, the SEBS Scholarship Foundation is a non-profit public charity dedicated to helping SEBS students afford to further their education. We do this by providing yearly scholarships to graduating SEBS seniors who demonstrate characteristics that align with our core values.</p>

                <p>We aim to benefit students who demonstrate the following characteristics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Persist in the face of challenges, both academic and personal.</li>
                    <li>Desire to improve the world around them.</li>
                    <li>Maintain an uncompromising character that demonstrates strength, respect, and honesty.</li>
                    <li>Demonstrate leadership potential and emotional maturity.</li>
                    <li>Shows enthusiasm in learning and takes initiative in one's own education.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We believe that the education earned at SEBS prepares students for a lifetime of success, should they choose to apply all theyâ€™ve learned. However, soon after graduation we learned just how expensive higher education is, yet we recognize its importance for those wanting to take the next step towards their career. Because of this, we decided to start the SEBS Scholarship, with the intention of lessening the financial burden on the students and families of those graduating from SEBS.</p>
                <p><i><b>To the graduating seniors at SEBS &#8212;</b><br>If you believe you possess the above characteristics, we strongly encourage you to apply to our scholarship. We look forward to learning more about you and wish you all the best in your college endeavors.</i></p>
